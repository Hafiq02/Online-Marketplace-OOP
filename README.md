Java code for Online Marketplace

This Java code encompasses the Customer class, which embodies customer entities within an online shopping platform. Each customer maintains an order history and a shopping cart. Customers are empowered to add products to their shopping carts, remove items, and initiate orders. Upon order placement, it is documented in the customer's order history. This code, a key part of a more extensive e-commerce system, fosters user interactions and transaction handling. It's a prime example of object-oriented programming and constitutes an integral part of a comprehensive e-commerce platform, providing customers with browsing, shopping, and order tracking functionalities.
